###Solve Description
Here, we have a targetted string or array  and a sequence.

We just check start checking values from targetted string and match with every values from the sequence.

Once the values are checked from sequence, we break


###Time complexity:
O(n) as we iterate through the whole targetted strong or array in the worst situation.

###Space complexity
We don't need additional spaces for variables etc. So, constant time makes it O(1)
