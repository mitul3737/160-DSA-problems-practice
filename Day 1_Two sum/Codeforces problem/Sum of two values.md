You are given an array of n
 integers, and your task is to find two values (at distinct positions) whose sum is x
.

Input
The first input line has two integers n
 and x
: the array size and the target sum.

The second line has n integers a1,a2,…,an
: the array values.

Constraints:

2≤n≤2⋅105
1≤x,ai≤109
Output
Print two integers: the positions of the values. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, print −1
.
